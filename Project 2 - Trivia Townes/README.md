## Trivia Townes
Trivia Townes provides a real-time, competitive multiplayer trivia experience. Users have the ability to join existing game lobbies or create custom lobbies based on question categories. Upon joining a lobby, users are redirected to a communal waiting page until the game begins. Player scores are updated throughout the game based on accuracy and speed. Scores are then persisted to a database and can be viewed on the global leaderboard.
